# Generative AI

A repository to capture my learnings and relevant resources for a structured journey into generative AI application development from basic concepts to deployed application. I hope to capture learnings for each stage from two perspectives:
 - Using open-source providers for ideation & validation - specifically [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)
 - Using cloud providers for operationalization at scale - specifically [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)

Along the way, I want to capture three kinds of resources:
 - Research Work - list interesting papers, projects and people.
 - Developer Tools - list useful tools, libraries and platforms.
 - Application Scenarios - identifify usage scenarios (E2E samples)
